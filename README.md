DowntimeService is written in Lua, and is a [Rojo](https://rojo.space) project by default. You can also require it by it's ID, which is **6317978171**. If you choose to manually grab the module, you can find it in GameFiles/MainModule or in the .rbxm file provided in the [releases.](https://github.com/Status-Plus/DowntimeService/releases)

## How does it work?

It sends API requests to a JSON endpoint on the main site. The main site checks major Roblox endpoints every 5 minutes for outages and slowness. It then can return *up*, *degraded*, or *down* when calling the function.
